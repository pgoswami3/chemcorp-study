<b> Creating the hypothesis with an emphasis on SMART principles. (S – Specific, M – Measurable, A – Achievable, R – Realistic, T – Timebound)</b>

## Problem Statement
X Inc, a Fortune 500 company, has a year-on-year average growth of 7% thanks to rising demand in the chemical market. 
Unfortunately, X’s sales revenue dropped by ~10% due to competition. 

<b> What opportunities exist for X to improve the sales numbers by 15% within the next 6,12 and 18 months? </b>

## Context
Constant rising demand for chemicals in various industries has given X Inc, a steady and robust growth, year after year. With favorable growth rates and lowered barriers to entry, other companies have stepped into the market. New start-ups are offering unique/similar chemicals at lower production costs, and this has caused our customers to re-evaluate their business at X. If this trend continues, then the board can lose confidence in existing management and its ability to resource strategic goals.

## Criteria for success
1) Customer Strategy, what, how, and which products bring the sales, total net profit, and how to maximize them.
2) Market opportunity, finding on which business segment and product delivers the highest profit margins and how to optimize them.
3) Product divestment, figuring out the most and the least profitable accounts and products and possible actions.

## Scope of solution space
• Using sales data, finding out which products are the most and the least profitable and possible action plans to improve the numbers. 

• Market Analysis, figuring out the highest profitable business segments and how to improve nos. of customers per business segment.

• Product divestment, finding low productive units, and possible actions.

• Suggesting areas for investment. 

## Constraints with solution space

1) Insufficient market data on competitors
2) Various business units where the customer base is distributed vastly, where divesting or discontinuing, will equally hurt the business. No low performing units and all are performing at average.
3) Limited data on influences shaping market trends
